## About

**Zorrotron: 1919** adapts the gameplay of _Robotron: 2084_, where players fight against a robot invasion to save what remains of humanity. Featuring fast-paced movement and shooting mechanics in chaotic game waves, **Zorrotron: 1919** introduces a unique twist: limited ammunition.

Set in 19th-century California, _The Legend of Zorro_ follows Don Diego de la Vega, a noble vigilante who defends the oppressed people in town against tyrannical officials. While Zorro's signature weapon is his famed sword, he occasionally uses a pistol—a fitting choice for this game.

The limited ammo mechanic incentivizes players to be strategic about managing and reloading ammunition while avoiding hazards and defeating enemies, adding a heightened sense of tension and necessary stealth.

Slip on Zorro's mask and face the challenge ahead—play **Zorrotron: 1919**!
